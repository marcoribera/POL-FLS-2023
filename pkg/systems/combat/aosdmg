AoS Dmg System

All sources of dmg have they dmg divided in 5 types: Physical, Fire, Cold, Poison and Energy.

Sources of dmg:

NPCs: In npcdesc they have the description of the dmg. Eg.: Liche have 80% of physical dmg and 20% of cold dmg. I put it in a Cprop dictionary: 
CProp DamageTypes d5:S8:Physicalr1.0S4:Firer0.0S4:Coldr0S6:Poisonr0S6:Energyr0
This means that tge creature with this Cprop have 1.0 (100%) of Physical Dmg.
TODO: maybe a more human readable Cprop?

Weapons: I assume that weapons without Cprops are 100% physical dmg. The only way that weapons can have other type of dmg are using diferent types of ingots/materials, then, when a weapon is crafted I check if the material give any type of dmg, Eg: Copper Weapons are 70% physical, 10% Poison and 20% Energy. Exceptional weapons have +30% randomly distributed in all types of dmg.

Spells: The dmg is defined when you call ApplyRawDamageEX in the spell script.

Resistances:

NPCS: In npcdesc they have this section:
Physical-ResistMult	0.5
Fire-ResistMult		1.0
Cold-ResistMult		0.0
Poison-ResistMult	0.2
Energy-ResistMult	0.5

Players: They can have 2 ways to get Resistances:
1- Using Armors: Each piece of armor give a % in all resistances, I put it in a Cprop in itemdesc.cfg:
CProp Resistances d5:S8:Physicalr2.0S4:Firer4.0S4:Coldr3.0S6:Poisonr3.0S6:Energyr3.0
This means +2% of Physical Resistamce +4% of Fire Resistance, +3% of Cold Resistance, +3% of Poison Resistance and +3% of Energy.
Ingots and Hides give more bonus when the item is crafted.

2- Resisting Spells: The formula is (magicResist-40)/3)*2 (from stratics) to ALL resistances. if you are equiped with armor then the greater value is used.

Scripts:

To code this system I modified the files:

- npcdesc.cfg to write the resistances and dmg types in ALL npcs.

- itemdesc.cfg to wrote the resistances of all pieces of armors

- damage.inc with more new functions and modified the functions:
  - CalcDamageAmount: If a npc have 1.0 (100%) os resistance it is immune (and not with 0) and 
  - GetResistance: This function is a bit more complicated, if the mobile is a npc, then read the npcdesc or try to get a Cprop, if it is a player then get the resistances from equipment and from the Resisting Spells skill.
  - I added this function: GetDamageList(mobile, weapon), it will check if the mobile is a NPC or player, if NPC get the Cprop , if is a player get the Cprop from the weapon, if the weapon doesnt have Cprop return 100% Physical.

- crafting.inc to add the cprops when the item is crafted. To do this task I created a new include craftingUtil.inc with the following functions:

	- AddWeaponMaterialBonus(theitem, DmgMods, isExceptional := 0)
	- AddArmorMaterialBonus(theitem, ResistMods, isExceptional := 0)
	- AddExceptionalDamageMod(byref finaldmg)
	- AddExceptionalResistMod(byref finalresist)

- mainHitScript to calculate the dmg of each type and subtract the resistance then apply the result. To do it I added this :

	if ( rawdamage > 0 )
		var dmgList := dictionary;
		dmgList := getDamageList(attacker, weapon);
		var keylist := dmgList.keys();
		foreach type in keylist
			var typeDmg := basedamage * dmgList[type];
			var temp := ApplyRawDamageEX(defender, CInt(typeDmg), type  );
		endforeach
		keylist := 0;
		MakeBleed(defender);
	endif
